Crucially, we are told, “it’s down to where the jet stream is”.\\n\\nIn an appeal to authority, without identifying any specific sources, Esme Stallard, climate and science reporter, with the assistance of all-purpose hack Sean Seddon, tell us that “meteorologists say” the wet and cool weather is due to the position of the jet stream, a core of strong winds sitting about five to seven miles above the Earth’s surface, and which dictate much of the UK’s weather.\\n\\nThe jet stream, we are then told, marks the boundary of cold air to the north in the polar regions and hot air to the south, a contrast which produces pressure differences. And last year, the jet stream was positioned further north, so the UK saw warm and dry weather created by the high-pressure system sitting over the country.\\n\\nAccording to these BBC sages, what is different about this month is that the jet stream has been stuck to the south of the UK, meaning its low-pressure system has been bringing cold and wet weather.\\n\\nThis is actually a pretty poor explanation of the meridional flow pattern which has been dominating the weather for a couple of years now, but that is of less concern than the need to tie in the phenomenon with global warming.\\n\\nAnd here, the formula used is classic is its dishonesty. “Some scientists think”, we are told, as if that is sufficient authority for what comes next. These wondrously anonymous “scientists” apparently think that higher temperatures due to climate change in the Arctic are causing the jet stream to slow, increasing the likelihood of high pressure and hot weather remaining in place.

Russia went on to appoint a Moscow-friendly mayor in Melitopol.\\n\\nWhile commenting on the kidnapping of Fedorov, which was partially captured on video, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asserted that \"the actions of Russian invaders will be equated with the actions of ISIS terrorists.\"\\n\\nKlitschko suggested that the kidnappings were part of a pattern of \"un-human\" Russian troops choosing to ignore the international rules of war, noting that mayors are civilian targets.\\n\\n\"War also has rules,\" said Klitschko. \"But Russians [don\\'t] want the rules ... what they want is the symbol ... they can\\'t break the mood of the people and that\\'s why they kidnap the mayors.\"\\n\\n\"Its actually against all rules,\" Klitschko continued. \"We see how unfriendly, how un-human activity make Russians in our land.\"\\n\\nFollowing Russian bombing campaigns on Monday, the Kyiv mayor surveyed scenes of damage in the city alongside his brother Wladimir Klitschko, who is also a former world heavyweight boxing champion.\\n\\n\"That\\'s what Russia\\'s war against the civilians looks like,\" Wladimir Klitschko said while standing in the rubble in a video uploaded to Twitter. \"Destroyed buildings, destroyed infrastructure. [A] city bus just got hit by a rocket. Lives are getting lost, that\\'s the war that Russia started.\"\\n\\nAccording to the Ukrainian government, Monday\\'s Russian strikes on Kyiv also included a missile hitting a nine-story residential building, leaving two dead and three others hospitalized.\\n\\nNewsweek reached out to the Embassy of Russia in Washington, D.C., for comment.\\n\\nAbout the writer\\n\\nAila Slisco is a Newsweek night reporter based in New York.

These are the culprits, and if you follow the money up the line, it leads straight to the corporate gurus and globalists who are urging all humans to stop eating meat and eggs, and start eating grub worms and cockroaches, in order to save the planet from… global warming. Sure. Meanwhile, at the Davos convention, the globalists are all eating salmon and steaks. So, you were saying?\\n\\nIt\\'s now more than obvious there is a deliberate war on food being waged against civilians by the globalists. Centralized suppliers, especially those that supply rural farmers that are mostly Conservatives and Republicans, are obviously out to cripple the egg supply, as strong evidence comes from two particular brands of feed these farmers use regularly.\\n\\nThis tragedy is forcing people to connect the dots and realize that it\\'s not just the hen food that\\'s causing production and infertility problems, but the human food as well. Egg farmers are now on the record saying, “If they are willing to poison my chickens to prevent me from supplying myself or others with eggs, then surely they would poison the food I eat and feed my family.”\\n\\nThere is a massive public awakening happening now, as food prices soar and supplies get choked out. More people are dying right and left from \"unknown causes\" and it\\'s getting worse by the day. People are dropping dead from heart attacks and strokes and many fewer humans have been having babies over the past few years, since the scamdemic began. Coincidence? It\\'s population reduction, and it\\'s a war being waged using food, medicine, viruses, dirty vaccines, and supply chain dismantling.\\n\\nTune your food news frequency to FoodSupply.news and get updates on more toxic foods and food shortages coming soon to stores near you.\\n', 'label': 2}, {'text': 'Ukrainian terrorist hot air balloon shot down over Russia \\n\\n The Russian military shot down a Ukrainian hot air balloon over the Kursk region of Russia. They wanted to use the aerostat to carry out a terrorist attack on targets inside Russia, the Defence Ministry said.\\n\\nThe department noted that on April 16 at about 8:15 a.m., air defence systems shot down a small hot air balloon over the territory of the Kursk region. No other details of the incident were provided.\\n\\nThe Armed Forces of Ukraine used similar aircraft during the special military operation. At the end of March, soldiers of the Russian Armed Forces shot down a \"terrorist balloon”, which was disguised as a probe.\\n\\nThe improvised hot air balloon bombers are equipped with a GPS tracker, flight control equipment, ballast, an explosive device and batteries. Coordinates for dropping the explosives are entered into the navigation controller of the balloon. Externally, the aerostat is disguised as a weather balloon to avoid damage.\\n\\nThe accuracy of such drones is not high for hitting targets on the contact line, so they are used to drop bombs on populated areas.\\n\\nIn February 2023, former Ukrainian air force spokesman Yuriy Ignat said that Russia was using balloons with radar corner reflectors to deplete Kyiv\\'s air defence system.\\n\\nSpecially equipped balloons can be used to combat drones, Sergei Bendin, acting head of the Moscow branch of the Aeronautics Commission of the Russian Geographical Society said.\\n\\nManned and unmanned airships may carry means of electronic warfare that could protect the military from drones.

Thunberg was not advocating for banks to “save the world.”\\n\\nFact Check:\\n\\nThunberg recently pulled out of an appearance at the Edinburgh International Book festival, BBC reported. The event was sponsored by the company Baillie Gifford and Thunberg refused to appear at the event claiming that Baillie Gifford, “invests heavily in the fossil fuel industry.”\\n\\nThe Facebook post purports Thunberg suggested the way to save the world is to save the banks. The post shared a small clip from an interview with Thunberg in which the audience claps after her alleged statement.\\n\\n“The money is there if we can save the banks, we can save the world,” she says in the clip. The caption reads, “GRETA – Saying the quiet parts out loud. The only way to save the planet is to save the banks.”\\n\\nThe clip is taken out of context. Check Your Fact conducted a reverse image and found the clip stems from a conference called, ‘The Right to a Future’ held by The Intercept.\\n\\nThe interviewer asks Greta about her rebuttal to governments saying fighting climate change is “too expensive.” The full exchange features Thunberg arguing that world governments have enough money to help curb climate change suggesting if there is “enough money to bail out the banks, then there is enough money to help the environment.” (RELATED: Did RFK Jr. Meet With Then-President Trump To Lead A Vaccine Safety Commission?)\\n\\nThere is no credible news report that suggests she was making this claim or had recently made such a remark.\\n\\nThis is not the first time a misinformation has been shared online.

These facilities were used to supply fuel for the military hardware of the armed forces of the Kyiv regime. On the next day, on July 19, the Russian military delivered another round of strikes on such targets. E\\n\\nxplosions were reported in the countryside of Odessa, including the Illichevsk port area where a large fuel storage depot was allegedly destroyed. Other sources claim that strikes also hit positions of Ukrainian air defense facilities in the Radujniy area.\\n\\nThe cost of the Russian withdrawal from the grain deal and strikes on the Odessa port infrastructure for Kyiv and its puppeteers already exceeded any damage suffered by Russia from terrorist attacks aimed against Crimea. \\n\\nNonetheless, NATO HQs demonstrate little ability to draw conclusions from observed reality. On July 19, Crimean authorities shut down a local highway and ordered the evacuation of about 2,200 people from four settlements in the east of the peninsula. The decision was made after an ammunition depot in the area close to the evacuated villages “caught fire”. \\n\\nReports say that the fire was caused by a strike launched by the Kyiv regime. NATO-supplied Storm Shadow missiles were allegedly employed. \\n\\nBy such actions, NATO and Kyiv have been consistently pushing Russia to the long-delayed but needed decisions regarding the elimination of military infrastructure in Odessa and nearby areas.\\n', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Russian On-air Protester Fined, Faces Possible Prison Term \\n\\n NEW YORK—An employee of Russian state television who interrupted a live news program to protest the war in Ukraine was released from custody Tuesday and fined about $270, but still could face a prison sentence.\\n\\nMarina Ovsyannikova told reporters she was not allowed to sleep while held in police custody and that she was interrogated for 14 hours.\\n\\nOvsyannikova, an employee of Channel 1, walked behind the presenter during Monday’s evening news show with a poster saying “stop the war, don’t believe the propaganda, they are lying to you here.” In English, it said “no war” at the top of the poster and “Russians against the war” at the bottom.\\n\\nIn a video recorded earlier, she urged Russians to join anti-war protests and said that “Russia is the aggressor country and one person, Vladimir Putin, solely bears responsibility for that aggression.”\\n\\nThe state news agency Tass said Ovsyannikova was fined for the video and remains under investigation for the on-air protest under a law banning dissemination of “deliberately false information” about the use of Russian armed forces.

The video, which originally stems from TikTok, has garnered over 1,000 views as of writing.\\n\\nThe claim is false, however. The Unilad article, published on Mar. 1, 2024, makes it clear that injecting ice particles into the atmosphere is only a “proposed solution” and has not been put into practice. The article also indicates the proposal is a collaboration between NASA and NOAA and references a recent piece from the Daily Mail that cites a study conducted by NOAA physicist Josh Schwarz.\\n\\nAccording to the study, the concept is called intentional stratospheric dehydration and “would involve dispersing small particles (known as ice nuclei) into high altitude regions of the atmosphere that are both very cold and super-saturated in water vapor. These nuclei would increase the formation of ice crystals that otherwise would not have formed.”\\n\\n“This ‘[ISD]’ strategy would not counteract a large fraction of the forcing from carbon dioxide but may contribute to a portfolio of climate interventions by acting with different time and length scales of impact and risk than other interventions that are already under consideration,” Schwarz and his co-authors wrote in the same study.\\n\\nLikewise, Check Your Fact found no credible news reports to support the claim.

According to him, the $6 million bribe that was paid in cash to shut down the investigation into the First Son’s scandal eventually found its way to the Ukrainian Armed Forces and its military-intelligence agency.\\n\\nDerkach claimed to have proof of the secret court order that divided these funds between those two, with the first investing its portion into building up their country’s drone army while the second financed terrorist attacks like the assassination of Darya Dugina, which he specifically mentioned in the interview. These allegations expand upon the ones that he shared earlier this year regarding the real-world impact of Hunter’s corruption scandal, which were analyzed here at the time.\\n\\nOn the subject of Ukrainian assassinations and terrorism, Derkach said that the CIA and FBI actually condone these actions despite their public claims to the contrary, but he warned that this immoral policy will inevitably ricochet into the US itself. In particular, he cited FBI chief Christopher Wray’s testimony to Congress last April where he said that law enforcement officials fear that Crocus-like attacks are presently being plotted against their country.\\n\\nAbout that, it shouldn’t be forgotten that Ukraine’s military-intelligence service GUR is the chief suspect of Russia’s investigation into what became one of the worst terrorist attacks in its history, thus meaning that the portion of Burisma’s $6 million bribe that made its way into their hands likely financed part of it. In other words, the third-order effect of Hunter’s corruption scandal is that it was partially responsible for the brutal murder of innocent civilians halfway across the world some years later.\\n\\nThat’s already scandalous enough, but Derkach shared even more details about the other indirect consequences of this cover-up into the First Son’s illicit activities, adding that some GUR-linked figures have been connected to the Western narrative about September 2022’s Nord Stream terrorist attack. He regards that story as a distraction from the US’ complicity, the view of which was elaborated upon here at the time that it entered the discourse, but lauded the CIA for the lengths it went to cover up its role.\\n\\nIn his view, the CIA might very well have sent a highly trained Ukrainian diving team to the Baltic Sea exactly as the Western media reported, though only to plant fake bombs. In his words, “when a cover story is made, it is done quite well. We shouldn’t belittle the experience of the CIA or the experience of MI6 in preparing cover operations. They have quite a lot of experience in using proxies, in using cover stories to form a certain position in order to dodge responsibility. This is actually what happened.”\\n\\nLooking forward, Derkach expects Ukraine to attempt more terrorist attacks against Russia, which the US public is being preconditioned to accept via the CIA’s various leaks to the media. While many might lay the blame for all this on Zelensky’s lap, Derkach believes that it’s actually his Chief of Staff Andrey Yermak who’s running the show, albeit as a Western puppet. Nevertheless, he’s also convinced that the West is indeed preparing to formally replace Zelensky, but doesn’t yet know when or with whom.\\n\\nAltogether, the importance of Derkach’s interview is that he’s a former veteran Ukrainian politician who still retains a lot of sources inside the regime, having served in the Rada for a whopping 22 years from 1998-2020. While his homeland charged him with treason after he fled to Russia in early 2022, which followed the US charging him with election meddling on behalf of that country in September 2020, the argument can be made that these are politically driven attempts to intimidate a top whistleblower.\\n\\nThe dirt that Derkach shared about Hunter’s Burisma corruption scandal, not to mention its newly revealed third-order effects that led to the brutal killing of civilians halfway across the world after part of his company’s bribe made its way into GUR’s hands, made him an enemy of the US Government.

In other words, the third-order effect of Hunter’s corruption scandal is that it was partially responsible for the brutal murder of innocent civilians halfway across the world some years later.\\n\\nThat’s already scandalous enough, but Derkach shared even more details about the other indirect consequences of this cover-up into the First Son’s illicit activities, adding that some GUR-linked figures have been connected to the Western narrative about September 2022’s Nord Stream terrorist attack. He regards that story as a distraction from the US’ complicity, the view of which was elaborated upon here at the time that it entered the discourse, but lauded the CIA for the lengths it went to cover up its role.\\n\\nIn his view, the CIA might very well have sent a highly trained Ukrainian diving team to the Baltic Sea exactly as the Western media reported, though only to plant fake bombs. In his words, “when a cover story is made, it is done quite well. We shouldn’t belittle the experience of the CIA or the experience of MI6 in preparing cover operations. They have quite a lot of experience in using proxies, in using cover stories to form a certain position in order to dodge responsibility. This is actually what happened.”\\n\\nLooking forward, Derkach expects Ukraine to attempt more terrorist attacks against Russia, which the US public is being preconditioned to accept via the CIA’s various leaks to the media. While many might lay the blame for all this on Zelensky’s lap, Derkach believes that it’s actually his Chief of Staff Andrey Yermak who’s running the show, albeit as a Western puppet. Nevertheless, he’s also convinced that the West is indeed preparing to formally replace Zelensky, but doesn’t yet know when or with whom.\\n\\nAltogether, the importance of Derkach’s interview is that he’s a former veteran Ukrainian politician who still retains a lot of sources inside the regime, having served in the Rada for a whopping 22 years from 1998-2020. While his homeland charged him with treason after he fled to Russia in early 2022, which followed the US charging him with election meddling on behalf of that country in September 2020, the argument can be made that these are politically driven attempts to intimidate a top whistleblower.\\n\\nThe dirt that Derkach shared about Hunter’s Burisma corruption scandal, not to mention its newly revealed third-order effects that led to the brutal killing of civilians halfway across the world after part of his company’s bribe made its way into GUR’s hands, made him an enemy of the US Government. They and their Ukrainian proxies will therefore always try to discredit him with sensational allegations, but everyone would do well to listen to what he says and then make up their own minds about it.\", 'label': 1}, {'text': 'NATO ‘Cautiously Optimistic’ Amid Reports of Russian Troop Withdrawal \\n\\n After Russia announced Tuesday that it will pull out some troops from near the Ukrainian border, top NATO officials expressed that they are “cautiously optimistic” for a de-escalation of tensions.\\n\\n“There are signs from Moscow that diplomacy should continue.

Several countries, including Russia, Australia and Israel are opposing efforts by other nations to pass a binding resolution at the United Nations calling for a ban on AI killer drones.\\n\\nThe issue surrounding the deployment of AI weapons has sparked intense debate, with key questions revolving around the role of human agency in the use of force. Austria’s chief negotiator on the matter, Alexander Kmentt, emphasised that this issue is not just a security and legal concern but also an ethical one.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Pentagon has revealed plans to deploy swarms of AI-enabled drones as part of their AI weapons programme. These drones, equipped with advanced AI capabilities, are intended to provide the United States with a tactical advantage, countering the numerical superiority of China’s Liberation Army.\\n\\nUS Deputy Secretary of Defence Kathleen Hicks further highlighted the role of AI-controlled drone swarms in reshaping battlefield dynamics, making them harder to plan against, hit and defeat. However, concerns arise regarding human supervision and decision-making capabilities, as some argue that limitations on AI’s autonomy could hinder strategic advantages.\\n\\nCritics also point to recent incidents where AI drones have been utilised in conflict zones, such as Ukraine’s use of AI-controlled drones during its conflict with Russia. The extent of human casualties caused by these AI drones remains uncertain, raising additional concerns.\\n\\nAdvocacy groups like the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots warn that AI technology’s dehumanisation poses significant risks. This dehumanisation could not only impact the use of force but also permeate other aspects of our lives, extending to automation in law enforcement, smart homes, and beyond. The campaign notes the urgent need for a global treaty banning autonomous weapons to prevent the wide-scale production and proliferation of these technologies from potentially falling into the wrong hands.', 'label': 1}, {'text': '14/05/2022 Ukrainians show strength at Deaflympics in Brazil \\n\\n Ukrainians show strength at Deaflympics in Brazil\\n\\nCaxias do Sul (Brazil) (AFP) – When Rymma Filimoshkina practiced the hammer throw in the yard near her house in Mariupol at the start of the Ukraine war, her neighbors thought she was throwing a bomb.\\n\\nIssued on:\\n\\nBut her \"weapon\" isn\\'t one of destruction: it just won the 33-year-old deaf athlete a gold medal at the Deaflympics in Brazil.\\n\\nThousands of kilometers (miles) from the conflict at home, the Ukrainian team is raking in the medals at the Olympics for the deaf, which opened on May 1 and wrap up Sunday in the southern city of Caxias do Sul.\\n\\nWith two days left to go in the Games, Ukraine had a commanding lead in the medal table, with a total of 116 -- more than double the second-place United States.\\n\\n\"In this event, we show the world we exist: we are Ukraine, a real powerful, independent and democratic country,\" said Valeriy Sushkevych, president of the Ukraine Paralympic committee.\\n\\n\"One soldier called us and said: in between battles, we support you on TV.

Since the 2014 coup d’état, Kiev has been a key player in modern slavery, particularly for human trafficking and sexual exploitation networks. The political and social instability that has affected the country since the Western-led regime change operation is one of the main factors for the growth of such human rights violations.\\n\\nA recent investigative report published by the Foundation to Battle Injustice showed in details the seriousness of the slave trade in Ukraine. According to the organization, Kiev has become one of the main global hubs in the human trafficking market, with free exploitation and circulation of irregular workers – in addition to the well-known trafficking of women and children in the predatory sex market.\\n\\nThe study points out that more than 300,000 Ukrainians were victims of the slave market between 1991 and 2021. This situation, however, has deteriorated even further since Vladimir Zelensky came to power. It is estimated that since the beginning of Zelensky’s government, more than 550,000 Ukrainians have been enslaved. These numbers are alarming and place Ukraine as one of the main agents of human trafficking in the entire world.\\n\\nIn its report, citing sources familiar with the topic and several insiders, the Foundation exposed how the slave trade in Ukraine is not limited to the exploitation of Ukrainian citizens. Since 2021, two reception centers for refugees from Africa have been operating in Ternopil. These facilities were used not only for receiving migrants but also for selling them on the European black market. An alleged member of the Ukrainian Presidential Cabinet, on condition of anonymity, reported to investigators that the organizer of the Ukrainian human trafficking network is Ruslan Stefanchuk, current chairman of the Verkhovna Rada.\\n\\nIt is said that Stefanchuk is the main beneficiary and coordinator of human trafficking networks in Ukraine, working both in the sale of Ukrainian citizens on the international black market and in the exploitation of foreigners who arrive through migratory flows and are handed over to criminal networks in Europe. Relatives of the Ukrainian parliamentarian also appear to be involved in such activities, as a large network of private companies is legally registered in the name of people close to him, such as his brother, Mykola Stefanchuck, and his wife, Marina Stefanchuk.\\n\\nStefanchuk and his relatives’ companies have the function of disguising the slave trade, making it appear to be a legal business. Advertisements are made to “help” people in various ways, such as offering employment or financial assistance. Thus, migrants, refugees and vulnerable Ukrainians are lured into meetings and interviews by supposedly legal and responsible companies, but soon after the meetings their documents are confiscated, and these people are captured and handed over to criminal networks.\\n\\n“Everything is built to look as legal as possible. Ukrainian women, children and men are invited for interviews at respectable companies in Kiev, Ternopil, Lviv or Ivano-Frankivsk. They are made tempting financial offers and paradisiacal working conditions. Then, under a plausible pretext, their identity cards are confiscated. After that, they can do absolutely anything they want with them,” source told investigators.\\n\\nThis type of situation is not surprising. In Ukraine, several crimes are committed with impunity by high-ranking state officials. Illegal work, sexual exploitation of women and children, military enlistment of children and even organ trafficking have been frequently reported in the country. It is worth remembering the case of Vasily Prozorov, a former Ukrainian secret service agent who emigrated to Russia and has done important work exposing Kiev’s crimes. According to him, there is a criminal network of trafficking and exploitation of Ukrainian children in pedophile schemes in which Western officials are deeply involved.\\n', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Geopolitics of human trafficking: How Western regime-change operations enable criminal activities \\n\\n\\nThe slave trade in Ukraine has become one of the most serious problems of our time.

This situation, however, has deteriorated even further since Vladimir Zelensky came to power. It is estimated that since the beginning of Zelensky’s government, more than 550,000 Ukrainians have been enslaved.

Since 2021, two reception centers for refugees from Africa have been operating in Ternopil. These facilities were used not only for receiving migrants but also for selling them on the European black market. An alleged member of the Ukrainian Presidential Cabinet, on condition of anonymity, reported to investigators that the organizer of the Ukrainian human trafficking network is Ruslan Stefanchuk, current chairman of the Verkhovna Rada.\\n\\nIt is said that Stefanchuk is the main beneficiary and coordinator of human trafficking networks in Ukraine, working both in the sale of Ukrainian citizens on the international black market and in the exploitation of foreigners who arrive through migratory flows and are handed over to criminal networks in Europe.

In Ukraine, several crimes are committed with impunity by high-ranking state officials. Illegal work, sexual exploitation of women and children, military enlistment of children and even organ trafficking have been frequently reported in the country.

In return, the Germans should agree to resuming their war against Russia on US terms.\\n\\nThis was known in Washington as the M PROJECT. It was devised by a group of American co-religionists, with a common ethnic origin and a shared belief in the evil of everything Russia stood for, including their religion.\\n\\nThe M PROJECT was the brainchild of the head of US intelligence, the White House military advisor, and other generals and admirals. They were all Irish-American Roman Catholics.\\n\\nThrough a special emissary code-named DAISY, they attempted to recruit their German co-religionists in the plan. To earn their reward, the Germans’ job was to arrange a coup d’état in Berlin; kill Adolph Hitler; and hurry up, before the Russian Army made good its advance through Ukraine, Poland, and on to Berlin.\\n\\nThis was the M PROJECT of 1943. President Franklin Roosevelt knew nothing of it. It failed, but the secret was kept for more than thirty years. By then, the US didn’t need to persuade the Germans by killing their chancellor. They do have a problem this week, though, to compel the new chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to join the M&M PROJECT – that’s the old M PROJECT modernized by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his deputy Victoria Nuland, for a new push through the Ukraine front.\\n\\nThe Germans must hurry this time too. The M&M PROJECT is due to start on Tuesday this week, according to Bloomberg. The Times of London says it will be Wednesday. The White House national security advisor, Jake Sullivan, an Irish-American, says it will be “any day now.”\\n\\nOn Friday, this and a great many preceding and succeeding murder plots and invasions devised by US officials will be exposed in the new book from Dances with Bears.\\n\\n', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Video shows brave Ukrainian vehicle take on more powerful Russian tank and WIN – as Putin has now lost 20,000 troops \\n\\n THIS is the astonishing moment a Ukrainian armoured vehicle bravely takes on a vastly more powerful Russian tank in a ferocious firefight -

Now, it wants to be part of the solution by profiting from the removal of the very same environmental toxins.\\n\\nI think California Resources Corp. could pay for this sequestration itself in an attempt to mitigate the horrid effects it’s had on the human population over the decades.

Every city in the United States has become much worse over the past three years. Drive around. There’s not one city that’s gotten better in the United States, and it’s visible,” Carlson says during a forum at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa.\\n\\n“Our economy has degraded, the suicide rate has jumped, public filth and disorder and crime have exponentially increased, and yet, your concern is that the Ukrainians – a country most people can’t find out a map – who’ve received tens of billions of US tax dollars don’t have enough tanks. I think it’s a fair question to ask, like, where’s the concern for the United States in that?” Carlson asks Pence.\\n\\nTo which Pence responds, “It’s not my concern. Tucker, I’ve heard that routine from you before, but that’s not my concern.”\\n\\nSeveral conservatives on social media seized on the clip, including Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk, who shared a snippet of the exchange on Twitter and wrote, “Tucker Carlson just brutalized Mike Pence for prioritizing Ukraine despite a litany of social ills afflicting America.”\\n\\nThe former vice president shot back at Kirk on social media, sharing a clip with his full answer to Carlson that showed him explaining that under a Pence administration, the country would be able to tackle both issues affecting Ukraine and domestic problems at the same time.\\n\\n“Sorry [Charlie Kirk]. That is what we used to call FAKE NEWS. Here’s the full clip of my remarks if you’re interested,” Pence wrote in his tweet.\\n\\nIn the extended clip, Pence continues his response to Carlson by saying, “Anybody that says that we can’t be the leader of the free world and solve our problems at home has a pretty small view of the greatest nation on Earth.

It was an act of unrivaled industrial and environmental terrorism.\\n\\nIf Washington had been able to pin the explosions on Russia, as it initially hoped, it would have done so with full vigor.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has claimed that the West is “fed up” with the money pit that has become this war.\\n\\nPlus, the U.S. has now gotten itself involved in another war between Israel and Palestine, which has the potential to advance to World War 3. Speaking at a meeting with Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov and Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, Lavrov argued that “everyone is fed up” with Zelensky, the Russia 1 TV channel reported on Sunday.\\n\\nAccording to the broadcaster, the diplomat quoted Romanian Senator Diana Sosoaca, who directed an angry tirade at the Ukrainian president ahead of his visit to Bucharest last week. We all know that this war is a proxy war between Russia and the U.S., so there’s no way the rulers are going to stop financially backing Ukraine.\\n\\nSosoaca called on Romanian President Klaus Iohannis to prevent Zelensky, whom she described as an “arrogant and unconscionable traitor, including to his own country,” from addressing the Romanian parliament. The politician further warned of “bad” consequences should she “catch” the Ukrainian president at the parliament building. “We are going to war for Zelensky’s grain! March out of our country, godless man! If you think we will sit idly by, you are wrong!” Sosoaca stated.\\n\\nStop The Denial: Ukraine Is A Proxy War That Will Lead To Wider World War\\n\\nAccording to Romanian media, the Ukrainian leader’s planned speech to parliament was canceled during his visit last Tuesday. Speaking at a press conference alongside Johannis, Zelensky insisted that he had never intended to make an address.\\n\\nThe opinion of Kiev in Romania has been adversely affected by the recent inflow of cheap Ukrainian grain into the country, coupled with what some see as discriminatory treatment toward the Romanian ethnic minority in Ukraine. –RT\\n\\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank meetings in Marrakech on Saturday, Ukrainian Finance Minister Sergey Marchenko admitted that Kiev is being forced to make “twice the effort right now to convince our partners to provide us with support compared to the last annual meetings [in spring].” Part of that is because the U.S. has found another war to support, and one involving religion will be easier to escalate.', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'The Great Reset King pollutes Christmas message with “climate change” activism \\n\\n On Christmas day, when Christians are celebrating the birth of their Saviour, King Charles III used his Christmas message to push the “climate change” narrative.\\n\\n“Out of God’s Providence, we are blessed with much and it is incumbent on us to use this wisely. However, service to others is but one way of honouring the whole of creation, which after all is a manifestation of the divine. This is a belief shared by all religions,” Charles III said.\\n\\nThen he slipped seamlessly into climate activism. “To care for this creation is a responsibility owned by people of all faiths and of none. We care for the Earth for the sake of our children’s children. During my lifetime I’ve been so pleased to see a growing awareness of how we must protect the Earth and our natural world as the one home we all share.”\\n\\nWhat has that message got to do with the birth of Jesus and Jesus’ message for the world? Is he conflating religions? Is he attempting to dilute or usurp the “Our Saviour is born” message? Or, perhaps, he is attempting to merge his own beliefs into another to create a universal belief system he thinks we should all follow.\\n\\nBelow, Jordan Schachtel has more to say on Charles III using the world stage for his activism.\\n\\nOn Monday, King Charles III, who we sometimes refer to as the “WEF King” – because he’s one of the world’s most prominent anti-humans – dedicated a significant chunk of the Royal Family’s annual Christmas broadcast to the climate narrative.\\n\\nCharles began with a unifying, apolitical message about having compassion for others, along with a plethora of unifying slogans, before quickly turning heel and going full Klaus Schwab mode, under the guise of presenting a cause that is greater than ourselves.\\n\\n“We care for the Earth for the sake of our children’s children,” said Charles, who earlier this month flew on his very spacious private aircraft to the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference (“COP 28”).\\n\\n“During my lifetime I have been so pleased to see a growing awareness of how we must protect the Earth and our natural world as the one home which we all share,” said Charles, who has been serving as king since

However, the application was prepared by an Irish environmental consulting group, not Trump’s business. The application clearly uses global warming to add urgency to a permit application to build a seawall which will protect his property from erosion and storms.\\n\\nTrump’s previous attempts to build the seawall failed to win special approval from Ireland’s national government, so his business resubmitted the application citing global warming as the motivating factor. The seawall would consist of 200,000 tons of rock distributed along two miles of beach in front of Trump’s property.\\n\\n“The zoning application raises further questions about how the billionaire developer would confront a risk he has publicly minimized but that has been identified as a defining challenge of this era by world leaders, global industry and the American military,” claims Politico. “His public disavowal of climate science at the same time he moves to secure his own holdings against the effects of climate change also illustrates the conflict between his political rhetoric and the realities of running a business with seaside assets in the 21st century.”\\n\\nThe real estate mogul has a long history of skepticism about global warming. Trump has taken to Twitter to call global warming a “hoax,” “mythical,” a “con job,” “nonexistent,” and “bullshit.” Trump also has a long history of questioning the benefits of politically popular green power in favor of conventional energy sources. He views policies created to fight global warming as hurting U.S. manufacturing competitiveness with China. Trump has also vowed to “at a minimum” renegotiate the United Nation’s December’s Paris climate deal.\\n\\nTrump has also expressed extreme skepticism of wind and solar power which environmentalists claim are the best way to prevent global warming.\\n\\n“I will say wind is a problem because it’s very expensive to build the towers, very, very expensive, and as you know when you have 40-dollar oil, it’s not economics, so they’re going to have to do a subsidy, otherwise wind isn’t going to work,” Trump said when pointing out problems with wind energy to The Washington Post.\\n\\nTrump even sued to prevent the construction of a new wind farm in Scotland which would have spoiled the view of a luxury golf resort he owns. Trump publicly stated he would stop development of the resort if the wind farm project went ahead.\\n\\nTrump has vehemently opposed wind power on Twitter, saying “nobody wants wind turbines, they are failing all over the world and need massive subsidy–a disaster for taxpayers” and asking “How many bald eagles did wind turbines kill today? They are an environmental & aesthetic disaster.”\\n\\nTrump’s skepticism of solar power is equally well documented, as he said in a 2012 interview with Greta Van Susteren that solar panels are “economically, they’re not good. It’s a very, very poor form of energy. Solar, as you know, hasn’t caught on because, I mean, a solar panel takes 32 years — it’s a 32-year payback. Who wants a 32-year payback? The fact is, the technology is not there yet.”\\n\\nTrump’s stance on solar is markedly different from that of his likely Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who plans to build “half a billion” solar panels. One of Clinton’s biggest financial backers, hedge fund billionaire Warren Buffett, has invested billions into building just that type of solar panel.\\n\\n\", 'label': 1}, {'text': 'European leader calls on world, China to pressure Russia \\n\\n NUSA DUA – The European Council president urged global powers Tuesday to intensify pressure on Russia over its war against Ukraine, including Moscow\\'s biggest supporter, China, saying that this week\\'s meeting of the world\\'s largest economies was crucial to stopping Moscow\\'s push \"to use food and energy as weapons.”\\n\\nCharles Michel, speaking to reporters on the first day of the Group of 20 meeting in Bali, said the nine-month war waged by Russia, a permanent member of the U.N.

In turn, the allegations directed against Russia were used to justify the imposition of sweeping economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.\\n\\nAccording to President Obama (hours after the tragedy):\\n\\n“… the downing of MH17 should be “a wake-up call” to Europe to get serious about confronting Russia over Ukraine after EU leaders have proved reluctant to impose tought sanctions.” (Telegraph, July 18,2019)\\n\\nThe Wall Street Journal reports (July 18, 2014) that “Obama is getting his wish and Brussels is now weighing new sanctions”:\\n\\nEuropean governments, jolted by the downing of a passenger plane over eastern Ukraine that killed nearly 300 people, are contemplating a major expansion of sanctions on Russia as early as next week.\\n\\nEuropean Union leaders decided in recent days to expand the penalties to a broad new category of people and companies. But the apparent shooting down of a plane carrying more than 200 EU citizens has intensified a desire to act quickly and forcefully, including sanctions against oligarchs with ties to the Kremlin.\\n\\nIn Brussels, some diplomats described the incident as a game-changer. “It would have major consequences if it was certain it came from the rebels— major consequences,” said one official. (WSJ, July 18, 2014)\\n\\nOn July 22, 2014, The European Union decided to expand its sanctions blacklist against Moscow including Vladimir Putin’s inner circle.\\n\\nEU foreign ministers decided to “draw up further broad measures including an arms embargo and financial restrictions on Russian businesses, … following the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17.” (Guardian, July 22, 2019)\\n\\nMichel Chossudovsky, August 2019, updated July 17, 2020, July 16, 2022', 'label': 2}, {'text': 'They want you to freeze to death: Biden, Democrats ban mining of primary fossil fuels in Minnesota \\n\\n Exploiting their slight edge in number in the state\\'s House of Representatives, 70-64, the Democrats on Jan. 26 passed the historic legislation banning the mining of primary fossil fuels.

It’s totally top down.”\\n\\n“It’s not working either, because the American people are rejecting it all of the time. Whenever you see polls, they say they don’t trust Biden,” Carney noted.\\n\\nAn AP-NORC poll released this week found that 69 percent of Americans believe Biden’s economy is “poor,” and 64 percent disapprove of his management of the economy.\\n\\nCarney also commented on Friday’s jobs report from the U.S. Labor Department, noting that despite the numbers coming in under expectations, the report “almost guarantees two more hikes” from the Federal Reserve.\\n\\nHe made this same point in Friday’s Breitbart Business Digest, explaining that the June jobs report and data showing a 4.4 percent year-over-year growth in average hourly wages “are likely enough to lock-in a rate hike at the end-of-the-month Federal Open Market Committee meeting and tilt the balance in favor of another rate hike in September.”\\n\\nCOMMENTS\\n\\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\", 'label': 1}, {'text': 'How the U.S. can fight in Ukraine without leading to nuclear war \\n\\n Letters to the Editor: How the U.S. can fight in Ukraine without leading to nuclear war\\n\\nTo the editor: I read the letters to the editor, and there is a clear divide between those who think the U.S. and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should confront the aggressor, or whether that’s too likely to cause an escalation in the war.\\n\\nWhile many people draw parallels between Hitler and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, there is one very clear difference: Putin has nukes.\\n\\nNevertheless, while nuclear annihilation is a risk of escalation, appeasement of war criminals has never tamed them.

America is planning ultimately to invade Russia from the only nation that is only 300 miles away from Moscow (Russia’s central command — far closer than Cuba was to Washington DC during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis).\\n\\nHere, as proven in the links, are the historical facts, documenting the U.S. Government’s increasing aggression against Russia — using Ukraine as its primary springboard in its plan to conquer Russia:\\n\\nThe Obama Administration perpetrated in February 2014 a bloody Ukrainian coup (hidden behind popular anti-corruption Ukrainian demonstrations that the CIA and State Department had trained and organized local racist-fascist anti-Russian Ukrainians to lead) overthrowing the democratically elected President of Ukraine and replacing him by a racist-fascist (ideologically nazi) regime that immediately replaced Ukraine’s generals with ones to ethnically cleanse pro-Russian Ukrainians and kill some and terrorize the others to flee into Russia so as to get rid of the people in the Ukrainian regions that had voted 70% or more for that democratically elected President — and this ethnic cleansing would enable the nazi U.S.-installed regime in Ukraine to be ‘democratically elected’, and so to continue the U.S.-Government’s control over that country, on Russia’s border.\\n\\nFor the full details, see this.\\n\\nSo: all three of those phrases (“Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”, “unprovoked war in Ukraine”, and “Russian aggression against Ukraine”) are lies, which reverse the aggressor (purportedly Russia, but actually America) and the defender (purportedly Ukraine — which is America’s proxy in its war against Russia — but actually Russia).\\n\\nThe war in Ukraine started with Obama’s coup, not with Putin’s ultimate response to it (which occurred soon after America’s rejection on 7 January 2022, of Russia’s demand, NOT to allow Ukraine into NATO).\\n\\nAmerica’s plan here is to place its missiles on Ukraine’s border with Russia, only a five-minute-missile-flight away from blitz-nuking The Kremlin and thereby beheading Russia’s central command — too fast for Russia to be able to launch its retaliatory missiles.\\n\\nWhat is the power of lies?\\n\\nIn a U.N. General Assembly vote on November 14th, the U.N.

The southern border of our country is porous and millions of individuals from around the world have descended on our country.\\n\\nThese “undocumented migrants” include terrorists, drug dealers, and intelligence agents of countries such as our enemy, China. It should alarm every American that 22,233 Chinese nationals have illegally entered the United States since the beginning of the fiscal year in October. If this rate continues, this year’s total will easily top the 24,125 Chinese nationals who illegally entered the country last year.\\n\\nTRUTH LIVES on at https://sgtreport.tv/\\n\\nThere has been an astounding 6,300% increase in the number of Chinese nationals illegally entering the country in the last few years. Since China is a communist nation, these individuals are not freely traveling to the United States for a “better life.” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall (R-KS) believes the influx is due to “the direction of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)” and it involves “espionage” as well as “stealing military and economic secrets.”\\n\\nLast year, China sent a spy balloon over our country, and it was not shot down until it completed its trek across many states. In addition, Chinese investors are buying American farmland for nefarious reasons, and it was confirmed that China operated “police stations” in the United States to monitor their citizens in our country.\\n\\nChina is constantly threatening Taiwan and its other neighbors while building up its military forces. Their proxy state, North Korea, has started regularly testing long-range ballistic missiles that concern their neighboring countries.\\n\\nUkraine is in the third year of a bitter war with Russia. Last year, a United States report estimated that the total number of injuries and deaths in the war neared 500,000. There is no end in sight to the war as no peace talks are planned and the United States Congress is on the verge of allocating more military aid to Ukraine.\\n\\nOn October 7, Israel was invaded by Hamas resulting in the death of 1,200 innocent people. It was the deadliest attack on Israel since its founding in 1948. Hamas abducted over 240 hostages and 129 have not been returned home. These hostages either remain in captivity or are already deceased.\\n\\nAs Israel has responded to the Hamas invasion by sending military forces into Gaza, many Democrats have been critical. Sadly, innocent civilians have been killed in the conflict, but how can a nation survive with a terrorist organization operating on its border?\\n\\nTo further strengthen their security, on April 1, Israel bombed the Iranian embassy in Damascus, Syria. Among the seven officials killed in the airstrike were Iranian Brig. Gen. Mohammad Reza Zahedi, who helped plan the October 7 massacre in Israel.\\n\\nTo retaliate for this strike, Iran launched over 300 drones and missiles into Israel on Saturday. Fortunately, almost all the strikes were intercepted by Israeli forces, with help from the United States, Jordan, and other countries.\\n\\nAs the world waits to see if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will respond to this attack, the Iranians are continuing to issue threats.

Rearden, Mr. McGonigal committed his violation of the IEEPA during the spring and fall of 2021, when he accepted over $17,000 to assist Russian energy mogul Oleg Deripaska by gathering negative information about one of Deripaska’s competitors.\\n\\nSentencing is set Dec. 14 for Mr. McGonigal, 55, who could spend up to five years in prison.\\n\\n“After his tenure as a high-level FBI official who supervised and participated in investigations of Russian oligarchs, Charles McGonigal has now admitted that he agreed to evade U.S. sanctions by providing services to one of those oligarchs, Oleg Deripaska,“ U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said, according to the press release. ”This Office will continue to hold to account those who violate U.S. sanctions for their own financial benefit.”\\n\\nMr. Williams lauded the exceptional performance of the FBI New York Field Office’s Counterintelligence Division as well as the assistance provided by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the New York City Police Department.\\n\\nThe Former Agent’s PositionFrom 2016 to 2018, Mr. McGonigal oversaw the FBI’s counterintelligence operations in New York as special agent in charge. He directed probes of Russian oligarchs such as Deripaska, who was sanctioned by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury in 2018.\\n\\nIn 2018, Washington banned nearly two dozen Russian billionaires and government officials in response to the now-debunked allegations of collusion between then-candidate Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and the Russian government. Among those targeted was Mr. Deripaska, the founder of Russian aluminum firm Rusal.\\n\\nMr. Deripaska’s sanctions were upheld by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia after the court found evidence he had acted as an agent for Russian President Vladimir Putin.\\n\\nMr. McGonigal, who wept as he spoke about his crime, said Mr. Deripaska had sent him at least $17,000 via a bank in Cypress and a firm in New Jersey before depositing the money into his bank account.\\n\\nIn January 2023, authorities alleged that Mr. McGonigal had received undisclosed payments from Mr. Deripaska in exchange for investigating a rival oligarch and unsuccessfully pushing to lift U.S. sanctions on the Russian billionaire.\\n\\nAccording to a news release issued by the Department of Justice on Jan. 23, it was alleged that Mr. McGonigal, on behalf of Mr. Deripaska, “fraudulently used a U.S. entity to obscure their activity in violation of U.S. sanctions.”\\n\\nConnection to TrumpMr. McGonigal joined the FBI in 1996 and worked on Russian foreign counterintelligence and organized crime before taking part in probes into the crash of TWA Flight 800, the 1998 terrorist bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, and the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.\\n\\nIn 2016, he was promoted to head of the FBI’s New York Field Office’s Counterintelligence Division.\\n\\nThe DOJ was able to monitor Mr. Page’s communications because of a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant issued during President Trump’s 2016 campaign.

The agency cited the debt ceiling negotiations and frequent government shutdowns as one of the reasons for the downgrade, and this was prior to the US losing its Speaker of the House for the first time in history.\\n\\nAnother reason is simply that China is disinvesting in the dollar.\\n\\nThe $2 billion sent to Israel is merely the beginning since the full-scale war has not yet begun.

Yet, in the name of “preservation,” entire segments of our food production are under siege.\\n\\nConsider rice – a staple for half the world’s population. Renowned agencies claim, “Rice accounts for roughly 10% of global methane emissions,” emphasising the urgent need to curtail its production. But the ramifications? Starvation for billions.\\n\\nLook to the Netherlands for further evidence. Dutch farmers, the backbone of a nation that is a leading exporter of meat and agricultural products, are being chased off their lands.

The tragic fallout is evident, with a reported 20 to 30 farmers tragically ending their lives annually.\\n\\nOur friends in Europe are no strangers to these baffling decisions either.

SEP/IYSSE public meeting in Sri Lanka \\n\\n The Socialist Equality Party (SEP) and the International Youth and Students for Social Equality (IYSSE) in Sri Lanka are holding an online meeting entitled “Oppose imperialist war!” on Thursday, May 23, at 7pm.\\n\\nIn announcing the recent International May Day Rally, David North, chairman of the International Editorial Board of the World Socialist Web Site, warned, “A third world war is not a distant possibility. The opening stages of this war are already underway.”\\n\\nIsrael’s genocide in Gaza against Palestinians and its US-backed attacks against Iran are just one front in a rapidly emerging world war involving nuclear armed powers. US imperialism and its allies are already engaged in a war against Russia in Ukraine and are making advanced preparations for a catastrophic conflict with China.\\n\\nThe imperialist leaders as well as various media pundits now casually refer to a nuclear war as an acceptable strategic option, despite the grave threat it poses to the existence of humanity.\\n\\nThe Biden administration, along with other NATO powers, have repeatedly crossed the “red lines” in Ukraine which they previously accepted as necessary to prevent nuclear war.\\n\\nOne might consider that the imperialist leaders—Biden, Sunak, Macron and Scholz—are criminally insane as they drag the planet towards nuclear conflagration. However, their policies are not simply the product of deranged individuals but of the profound crisis of world capitalism for which they have no rational, progressive solution and see a global war for domination as the only way out.\\n\\nWar is being accompanied by savage repression against any opposition as the terrible, continued persecution of Julian Assange for exposing the crimes of US imperialism graphically demonstrates.\\n\\nOur comrade Bogdan Syrotiuk of the Young Guard of Bolshevik Leninists has been detained by the fascistic Zelensky government in Ukraine earlier this month on false accusations of being a Russian agent. Bogdan has courageously opposed the war in Ukraine, along with his comrades in Russia, denounced both the Ukrainian and Russian regimes and fought for the unity of the Ukrainian and Russian working class.\\n\\nIn the US and other imperialist countries, brutal police crackdowns are taking place against protesters opposing the Gaza genocide with thousands of arrests including of students.\\n\\nThe ongoing anti-war protests in universities and cities are significant, but on their own are incapable of halting the bloodbath. For seven months, the Zionist regime and its imperialist backers have not only ignored protests by millions around the world, but they are also turning to police repression.\\n\\nThe only social force capable of halting the drive to world war is the international working class which is coming into struggle in Sri Lanka and around the world in opposition to the austerity program of the ruling classes. As governments engage in, support and prepare for war, it is workers who are forced to bear the burden.\\n\\nA struggle against war requires the building of a unified anti-war movement of the working class based on a socialist program, exposing the futility of protest politics and all the apologists for imperialism. Appeals to capitalist governments are bankrupt.

Israel says Rafah is the last stronghold of the militant group.\\n\\nIn January, judges ordered Israel to do all it can to prevent death, destruction and any acts of genocide in Gaza, but the panel stopped short of ordering an end to the military offensive.\\n\\nThe court has already found that there is a “real and imminent risk” to the Palestinian people in Gaza by Israel’s military operations.\\n\\n“This may well be the last chance for the court to act,” said Irish lawyer Blinne Ni Ghralaigh, who is part of South Africa’s legal team.\\n\\nICJ judges have broad powers to order a ceasefire and other measures, though the court does not have its own enforcement apparatus.\\n\\nA 2022 order by the court demanding that Russia halt its full-scale invasion of Ukraine has so far gone unheeded.\\n\\nMost of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people have been displaced since fighting began.\\n\\nThe war began with a Hamas attack on southern Israel on October 7 in which Palestinian militants killed around 1,200 people and took about 250 hostages.\\n\\nGaza’s Health Ministry says more than 35,000 Palestinians have been killed in the war without distinguishing between civilians and combatants in its count.\\n\\nSouth Africa initiated proceedings in December 2023 and sees the legal campaign as rooted in issues central to its identity. Its governing party, the African National Congress, has long compared Israel’s policies in Gaza and the occupied West Bank to its own history under the apartheid regime of white minority rule, which restricted most Blacks to “homelands”. Apartheid ended in 1994.\\n\\nOn Sunday, Egypt announced it plans to join the case.

Putin certainly has the hardware for every scenario.\\n\\nAt his disposal are an estimated 5,977 warheads, of which 1,600 are ready to be deployed. This terrifying arsenal can be launched from land, submarines and planes.\\n\\nThey include non-strategic “battlefield” nukes which have a smaller destructive power — and radioactive fallout — and are intended to destroy military capabilities rather than civilian populations. They can be anything from land mines to torpedos.\\n\\nThey have never been used in combat — so far.\\n\\nMost read in The Sun\\n\\nRussia also has the more feared strategic nuclear weapons, which can be launched as warheads on powerful long-range missiles.\\n\\nThey include intercontinental ballistic missiles which would take just 20 minutes to get to Britain — and 30 to the US. These strategic weapons, with deliberately terrifying names such as Satan, are designed to wipe out entire cities.\\n\\nUnleashing such weapons would come with a huge amount of risk for Putin. He knows Nato forces have an equally deadly stockpile, with the US retaining 5,428 warheads alongside the UK’s 225 and France’s 290.\\n\\nBut he may not care about retaliation.\\n\\nThe Russian leader suggested in 2018 he would be willing to see his homeland destroyed in a nuclear conflict.\\n\\nHe said: “If someone decides to annihilate Russia, we have the legal right to respond. Yes, it will be a catastrophe for humanity and for the world. But I’m a citizen of Russia and its head of state.\\n\\n“Why do we need a world without Russia in it?”\\n\\nThis, though, was clearly a threat to respond in kind if Russia is ever attacked first.\\n\\nSam Ashworth-Hayes, of the Henry Jackson Society, told The Sun previously: “I think there is only a risk of escalation if Nato forces did directly become involved in the war in Ukraine.\\n\\n“The message from Vladimir Putin to the West is to stay out of our business, because we will escalate if you interfere.”\\n\\nNato has made it clear it has no intention of intervening militarily in Ukraine. But one Russian analyst speculated Putin might fire a nuclear warning shot our way.\\n\\nPavel Felgenhauer, of the independently minded Novaya Gazeta, said: “One option for him is to cut gas supplies to Europe, hoping that will make the Europeans climb down. Another option is to explode a nuclear weapon somewhere over the North Sea between Britain and Denmark — and see what happens.”\\n\\nAnd US intelligence spies fear Russia might have an “escalate to de-escalate” policy, which means if they should find themselves in conflict with Nato, they would threaten to use low-yield nukes in order to bring a war to an end.\\n\\n\\'CONCERNING\\'\\n\\nMany wonder whether the former KGB spymaster has become unhinged enough to risk escalating a conflict in this way.\\n\\nBut one expert believes this could be a ploy. Professor Andrew Wilson, from UCL, said: “Putin is playing a bit on the crazy. The theory goes that if people think I am mad enough to use them then that plays to my advantage.”\\n\\nHowever, Mr Ashworth-Hayes thinks use of nukes is unlikely. He said: “It is important for people to stay calm. Tensions are very high, but there is no chance of either side launching nuclear weapons.\\n\\nREAD MORE SUN STORIES\\n\\n“Both the US and Russia have more than enough warheads to wipe each other out.\\n\\n“The concept of ‘mutually assured destruction’ still stands.”', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'JOURNO-TERRORISM: Bloomberg calls for climate terrorism across America, says “property destruction” is the only way to achieve climate justice \\n\\n Entitled \"The Climate Movement Needs to Embrace Property Destruction,\" the article chastises climate activists for not doing enough to \"reign [sic] in the fossil fuel industry.\"\\n\\nCiting Lund University professor and eco-terrorism proponent Andreas Malm, the article attempts to make the case that destroying public and private property is a powerful way to save the planet from global warming.\\n\\n\"The task for the climate movement is to make clear for people that building new pipelines, new gas terminals, opening new oil fields are acts of violence that need to be stopped – they kill people,\" Malm is quoted as saying on Bloomberg\\'s \"Green Zero\" podcast.\\n\\n\"We shouldn\\'t engage in assassinations or terrorism, or use arms and things like that.

Tuberville told the War Room audience, “Climate Change is the biggest hoax in the world.” He then added that he believes around 25% of the budget is dumped into climate change policies.\\n\\nThere are obviously a whole lot of grifters getting rich of the “hoax.”\\n\\nThe Democrat Party and their mainstream media will not be pleased with Tommy following his honest assessment of the international scam.\\n\\nSteve Bannon: Okay, so you’re a common sense guy, right? Big education guy. You’ve been around universities all your life. When you come and hear the presentations, when they come and present to you, is it nonsense? I mean, is it just voodoo?\\n\\nSen. Tuberville: Oh, the climate, yeah. Oh, it’s biggest hoax in the world. I mean, it’s all a money grab… We come in here at our budgets about near 5 trillion a year. What we run on, we’ve spent since I’ve been here, and I hadn’t voted for any of $7 trillion more than that since we’ve been here. Right. I would say 25% of that, Steve, has gone to climate change. I mean, it is the biggest hoax in the world. I mean, you’ve got this clown Kerry. That John Kerry. He doesn’t know what day it is most of the time. I think he’s right behind Joe Biden, and he’s pushed this narrative along with these money grabbers like Clinton and Gore and all the Democrats. I mean, it is all a money grab. This EV car system, you’re seeing it now. It’s crashing, crashing, burning. They can’t get anything out of the solar, no wind…\\n\\n…I lived in West Texas, coach at university at Texas Tech. I had a wind turbine, huge one, in my backyard, a couple hundred yards. You could hear it going around…\\n\\n…But if the wind’s not blowing on that turbine behind me, it’s got an electric generator running it. Yeah, that’s fueled by gas and oil. You just have to take a deep breath sometimes and see how deep of hole these people have dug themselves.\\n\\nSteve Bannon: Have they presented you any information or data or analysis that would make you say, some of this climate change stuff might be logical, or is it just all presented as essentially financial, economic voodoo?\\n\\nSen. Tuberville: Yeah, they don’t know enough about it. Now, you can get some of these big scientists who come in and try to push, but you look at the graphs and the narratives that they bring in… It’s a hoax. I’m telling you, it is a huge hoax. We’re all for our air, our water, taking care of what we do, but they’re making money off this. And again, that’s the Democrat party. They want to make money off everything they do.\\n', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Zelensky Seeks To Cancel Russia At UN, Asks Why \"Russian Terrorists\" Have A Place \\n\\n Zelensky Seeks To Cancel Russia At UN, Asks Why \"Russian Terrorists\" Have A Place\\n\\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is trying to use his visit to the United Nations in New York to get Russia canceled from the international assembly.

No date was given for when the existing plants would have to go, but other Biden regulatory actions and international commitments already in the works had meant no coal by 2035.\\n\\nThis is crazy and fascistic, as he calls for the elimination of a vital energy resource.\\n\\nJohn Kerry demands the end of coal plants.— Daniel Turner (@DanielTurnerPTF) December 4, 2023\\n\\nHere\\'s what Kerry won\\'t tell you:\\n\\n- Coal is inexpensive, abundant, and reliable\\n\\n- Solar manufacturing plants run on coal\\n\\n- Wind manufacturing plants run on coal\\n\\n- EV battery factories are powered by coal\\n\\nFacts matter. pic.twitter.com/V8cX2injQu\\n\\nKerry says there shouldn\\'t be any more permanent coal-fired power plants permitted anywhere in the world. He said that\\'s how you can do something for \"health.\" He said he finds himself getting more and more \"militant\" because he does not understand \"how adults [who] are in positions of responsibility can be avoiding responsibility for taking away those things that are killing people on a daily basis. And the reality is that the climate crisis and the health crisis are one and the same.\"\\n\\nYikes! How dare anyone disagree with him, he seemingly thinks, while he\\'s trying to crush industries and the jobs associated with them? We get that the Biden team doesn\\'t care about that, as they race pell-mell ahead with their agenda.\\n\\nBut it gets worse, as Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) point out. While the Biden team is pushing for this radical agenda that would limit and harm the U.S., Kerry gave China a pass by locking them into the status of a \"developing country\" according to the Paris Agreement, which Kerry helped to negotiate.\\n\\n“At the time the Paris Agreement was signed, China was the world’s second largest economy, and had been so for many years. Nevertheless, the treaty you negotiated and agreed to locked into place China’s status as a developing country. That was as absurd then as it is now,” the senators wrote. [....]\\n\\n“China is bent on global domination. It is the world’s second largest economy and largest emitter of greenhouse gases. It is America’s chief economic and geopolitical rival. It exploits forced labor. It manipulates global markets. It steals our technology. It is building hypersonic missiles and a blue-water navy,” the senators wrote. “It should not get special treatment in international climate agreements. There should be no more free rides for China. That should be non-negotiable.”\\n\\nBut it\\'s the Biden team, where giving China a pass seems to be baked in, so they\\'re building all the coal plants they can. And they\\'re using them to help build all the green energy stuff that the Biden team wants to shove down our throats.\\n\\nChina is acting within, and taking advantage of, the international framework you helped create—the Paris Agreement.

This assumes that doctors test people’s blood frivolously, something equivalent to an “unnecessary journey”. Very, very odd.\\n\\nBut the most egregious claim, of course, is that “Climate change is one of the biggest threats to human health”.\\n\\nThat is so far from truthful, and so utterly embedded in green ideology, that the word “lie” is not sufficient.\\n\\nThere is less than zero evidence that climate is a “threat to human health”, let alone the “biggest threat”. The evidence debunking the link between climate change and health is so strong that doctors have to go out of their way to conceal the stats.\\n\\nYou can see the raw data here for yourself. Climate-related mortality has fallen in recent decades. Diseases of poverty, which are claimed to be climate-linked, including malaria, are also in steep decline.\\n\\nI give an overview of how climate-activist doctors at the Lancet are influenced by ideology here, and go into more detail to explain how they lie in this presentation below. At around 36 mins, I show that the Lancet’s green propaganda pages hide the mortality statistics behind “frequency of event” statistics, to give the opposite impression.\\n\\nThe Lancet claims that “life-threatening extreme weather events are becoming increasingly frequent”. When you interrogate the data, however, it reveals that far fewer people are being killed by extreme weather.\\n\\nSo it’s not just a lie, it’s a fraud. And it’s a fraud told for political effect, to transform society and the economy, which ultimately will have a devastating effect on human health. And it already is, if we calculate the opportunity cost for people in emerging economies.\\n\\nDoctors and medical researchers involved in this propaganda have invented their own metric of “risk” to create “evidence” of a growing “threat”. And doctors and institutions of medicine that reproduce this propaganda do so *uncritically* without checking the numbers.\\n\\nThe numbers are not complicated. The science is not complicated. The data is not hard to find. This is not like 5-sigma high energy physics experimentation.\\n\\nConsider this chart from the latest Lancet propaganda report, for example. It claims that the better part of a $trillion is lost from agricultural production because of exposure to heat. But look at how small that effect is in the West, compared to developing/low income economies.\\n\\nWhereas farmers in the US can tend to vast farms, sitting in GPS-guided, air conditioned, diesel-powered tractors, subsistence agriculture is dawn-to-dusk manual labour.\\n\\nThe difference is access to fossil fuels. It’s not a weather or climate effect.\\n\\nTo frame that disparity between agricultural producers in the richest and poorest economies as one of “climate change”, requiring the abolition of fossil fuels is a grotesque injustice. It is vile.\\n', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Despite Yields Doubling, NYTimes Claims Vanilla Is Disappearing From Climate Change \\n\\n The New York Times is attempting to stoke climate alarm this week with an article claiming the world’s favorite scent – vanilla – is about to disappear because climate change is eradicating vanilla plants. [emphasis, links added]\\n\\nIn reality, objective data show vanilla production has doubled since the year 2000, and the current market is saturated with oversupply.\\n\\nThe Times article, “This Is How the World’s Favorite Scent Disappears,” notes vanilla is the world’s favorite scent and is used in a wide variety of perfumes and other products.\\n\\nCiting anecdotal events like a cyclone that hit Madagascar several years ago during its annual cyclone season, the Times claims supersized cyclones are putting vanilla plants on the verge of extinction.\\n\\nInterestingly, although the Times published its article just yesterday, the best anecdotal “evidence” for the asserted vanilla extinction was a cyclone that hit Madagascar way back in 2017 during its cyclone season.\\n\\nAccording to the Times, Madagascar produces 80 percent of the world’s vanilla – actually, it produces significantly less than 80 percent – and:\\n\\n“As a result [of the 2017 cyclone], the price of vanilla bean pods surged to nearly $300 a pound. The increasingly erratic weather, along with pressure to cut the forests that harbor the orchids, is particularly worrisome for farmers…”\\n\\nSo, why does the Times provide just anecdotal ‘evidence’ of climate change ravaging vanilla crops, and why does the Times have to go back to 2017 to find any such anecdotal evidence?\\n\\nThe answer is that objective facts expose the Times’ claim as false.\\n\\nThe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization provides detailed information on global crop production, including vanilla. According to the UN data, global vanilla production has doubled from 3.9 million kg of vanilla in 2000 to 7.7 million kg in 2022.\\n\\nThere is so much vanilla being produced that farmers are complaining about low vanilla prices caused by overproduction.\\n\\n“The 2023 vanilla crop is expected to be one of the best harvests in the last two decades, forecasted at 2,500 tons with exceptionally high quality,” observes the Nielsen-Massey 2023 Crop Report.\\n\\nThe Crop Report observes that recent strong production has created a market oversupply. “The oversupply has led to aggressive price reductions, posing economic challenges for vanilla farmers as they sell their 2022 crop at low prices to meet their daily living needs,” the Crop Report adds.\\n\\nWow, talk about the New York Times getting the story completely backward and wrong!\\n\\nThe New York Times points to a cyclone that hit Madagascar seven years ago during its cyclone season and caused a very short-term spike in vanilla prices.\\n\\nThat is its sole “evidence” of climate change making vanilla go extinct.\\n\\nIn reality, vanilla production is so strong that the market is saturated with vanilla, … making farmers complain about low prices.\\n\\nThe New York Times and other “mainstream” media outlets have a long history of identifying popular foods, beverages, and luxury items that climate change is allegedly destroying.\\n\\nAs is the case with all other such items that have come to Climate Realism’s attention, vanilla is becoming more abundant rather than less abundant as the planet modestly warms.\\n\\nTop photo of the Vanilla bean plant by Kristy An on Unsplash\\n\\n', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'Canadian Conservative Leader Poilievre Scorches Trudeau Over His ‘Carbon Tax’ Driving the Financial Crisis – But All the Prime Minister Wants To Talk About Is Ukraine!

End of story. Black and white. Russia bad. Ukraine good. Support Ukraine with U.S. taxpayer-funded cash and armaments. America good.\\n\\nIf we go back to the Cuban Missile Crisis, we find that things are not so simple, especially for American interventionists, even if they don’t realize it.\\nThe Soviets had installed nuclear missiles in Cuba that had the capability of hitting U.S. cities along the Eastern seaboard, including Washington, D.C., and New York City. The crisis lasted from October 16 through October 29, 1962.\\n\\nPresident Kennedy demanded that the Soviets remove their nuclear missiles from Cuba and take them back to the Soviet Union. The Pentagon was exerting enormous pressure on Kennedy to immediately initiate a surprise bombing attack on the suspected missile sites, followed by a full-scale regime-change military invasion of the island. In other words, they were pressuring Kennedy to do to Cuba what Russia has done to Ukraine. In fact, the pressure they placed on Kennedy was so intense that Robert Kennedy, the president’s brother, secretly told Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin “If the situation continues much longer, the President is not sure that the military will not overthrow him and seize power.”\\n\\nOn October 27 — two days before the crisis was resolved — Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev wrote a letter to Kennedy stating the following:\\nBut how are we, the Soviet Union, our Government, to assess your actions, which are expressed in the fact that you have surrounded the Soviet Union with military bases; surrounded our allies with military bases; placed military bases literally around our country; and stationed your missile armaments there? This is no secret. Responsible American personages openly declare that it is so. Your missiles are located in Britain, are located in Italy, and are aimed against us. Your missiles are located in Turkey.\\n\\nYou are disturbed over Cuba. You say that this disturbs you because it is 90 miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America. But Turkey adjoins us; our sentries patrol back and forth and see each other. Do you consider, then, that you have the right to demand security for your own country and the removal of the weapons you call offensive, but do not accord the same right to us? You have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in Turkey, literally next to us. How then can recognition of our equal military capacities be reconciled with such unequal relations between our great states? This is irreconcilable.\\n\\nDo you see the problem? Khrushchev was pointing out the hypocrisy of the U.S. position, a position that American interventionists today simply cannot recognize, owing to their blind allegiance to the U.S. national-security establishment.\\n\\nThe fact is that the Soviets had the legal authority to place their nuclear missiles in Cuba, just as Ukraine has the legal authority to join NATO. Cuba, like Ukraine, is a sovereign, independent country and, therefore, had the legal authority to permit the Soviets to install their missiles in Cuba, just as Ukraine has the legal authority to permit the U.S. and NATO to install their nuclear missiles in Ukraine.\\n\\nBut even though such legal authority exists, no one, including both Russians and Americans, likes to have nuclear missiles pointed at himself, especially from just a few miles away. This is the point that Kennedy was making when he stood fast during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

In fact, the pressure they placed on Kennedy was so intense that Robert Kennedy, the president’s brother, secretly told Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin “If the situation continues much longer, the President is not sure that the military will not overthrow him and seize power.”\\n\\nOn October 27 — two days before the crisis was resolved — Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev wrote a letter to Kennedy stating the following:\\nBut how are we, the Soviet Union, our Government, to assess your actions, which are expressed in the fact that you have surrounded the Soviet Union with military bases; surrounded our allies with military bases; placed military bases literally around our country; and stationed your missile armaments there? This is no secret. Responsible American personages openly declare that it is so. Your missiles are located in Britain, are located in Italy, and are aimed against us. Your missiles are located in Turkey.\\n\\nYou are disturbed over Cuba. You say that this disturbs you because it is 90 miles by sea from the coast of the United States of America. But Turkey adjoins us; our sentries patrol back and forth and see each other. Do you consider, then, that you have the right to demand security for your own country and the removal of the weapons you call offensive, but do not accord the same right to us? You have placed destructive missile weapons, which you call offensive, in Turkey, literally next to us. How then can recognition of our equal military capacities be reconciled with such unequal relations between our great states? This is irreconcilable.\\n\\nDo you see the problem? Khrushchev was pointing out the hypocrisy of the U.S. position, a position that American interventionists today simply cannot recognize, owing to their blind allegiance to the U.S. national-security establishment.\\n\\nThe fact is that the Soviets had the legal authority to place their nuclear missiles in Cuba, just as Ukraine has the legal authority to join NATO. Cuba, like Ukraine, is a sovereign, independent country and, therefore, had the legal authority to permit the Soviets to install their missiles in Cuba, just as Ukraine has the legal authority to permit the U.S. and NATO to install their nuclear missiles in Ukraine.\\n\\nBut even though such legal authority exists, no one, including both Russians and Americans, likes to have nuclear missiles pointed at himself, especially from just a few miles away. This is the point that Kennedy was making when he stood fast during the Cuban Missile Crisis. With the full support of the Pentagon and the CIA, he was willing to risk all-out nuclear war to force the Soviets to remove those missiles, even though he knew that the Soviets had the legal authority to install them in Cuba. He, the Pentagon, and the CIA simply did not like the fact that those missiles were so close to the United States.\\n\\nBut that’s precisely how the Soviets felt as well, which is what Khrushchev was expressing in his letter to Kennedy. He was essentially saying, “Hey, you don’t like our missiles in Cuba because they are so close to your country. That’s exactly how we feel as well, not only about your missiles over here that are painted at us but also about all your military bases with which you have surrounded us. How come you can’t understand that?”\\n\\nWell, Kennedy did come to understand that. That’s how he and Khrushchev were able to strike a deal, one that infuriated the U.S. national-security establishment as well as American interventionists.\\nThe deal consisted of two major parts: First, Kennedy vowed that he would not permit the Pentagon and the CIA to again invade Cuba and, second, Kennedy agreed to withdraw U.S. nuclear missiles in Turkey that were pointed at Russia.\\n\\nThe Joint Chiefs of Staff were livid. They considered Kennedy’s resolution of the crisis to be the worst defeat in U.S history. They compared his actions during the crisis to Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement of Hitler at Munich.\\n\\nFor their part, American interventionists were also furious over Kennedy’s resolution of the crisis. As far as they were concerned, the Pentagon and the CIA had the “right” to install their nuclear missiles wherever they want and the Soviets did not have the “right” to do the same. It’s a position that American interventionists still hold today.\\n\\nCan you see why American interventionists hated Kennedy so much and why the Pentagon and the CIA ultimately concluded that he constituted a grave threat to “national security”?\\n', 'label': 1}, {'text': 'CIA\\'s Burns & SecDef Austin In Separate \\'Urgent\\' Trips To Ukraine As War Effort Implodes \\n\\n CIA\\'s Burns & SecDef Austin In Separate \\'Urgent\\' Trips To Ukraine As War Effort Implodes\\n\\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin on Monday showed up in Kiev during an unannounced visit, and at an awkward moment for US-Ukraine relations given President Zelensky has been publicly complaining over a decrease in artillery shell supplies, given they are now going to Israel for its war in Gaza.\\n\\n\"I was honored to meet with President @ZelenskyyUa in Kyiv today to reaffirm the United States’ steadfast support for Ukraine,\" Austin wrote on X. \"We, along with our allies and partners, will continue to support Ukraine’s urgent battlefield needs and long-term defense requirements,\" Austin added.\\n\\nThis convenient shift of Washington and the Pentagon to talking mainly about \"long-term defense\" began occurring as it became clear Ukraine\\'s counteroffensive was failing.\\n\\nBut Congress has been dragging its feet on passing Biden\\'s latest supplemental funding requests - again given there\\'s been some wrangling over what gets sent to Israel vs. what\\'s set aside for Ukraine.\\n\\nThis is Austin\\'s second trip to Kiev since the Russian invasion. \"I’m here today to deliver an important message – the United States will continue to stand with Ukraine in their fight for freedom against Russia’s aggression, both now and into the future,\" he said.\\n\\nJust last week, CIA Director William Burns also made a secretive, unannounced visit to Ukraine to hold urgent meetings with Zelensky and top military and intelligence officials.
